            <p>People say free time is beautiful but I say without busy life it is boring.I am a DCIAN so you also saw me around Dhaka College.My friends  are DCIAN but you also saw them around Dhaka College and  Eden College. As a result, my status is single and my friends' status is mingle.Other College friends  know gf means girlfriend, otherside my college friends  know gf means Eden friend.But I know gf means growth factor because I am Zoologist. So don't  underestimate the power of a Zoologist.  </p>
